1. Kpoints and Encut optimal value in calibrate -- > implement knob_setting method in Measurement

2. Post-processing --> implement get_measurements function in the measurement class to calculate for example binding energy etc.

3. Apart from surface and ligand - application of 2-D materials to substrates and heterostructures
