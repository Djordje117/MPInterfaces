1. Kpoints and Encut optimal value in calibrate -- > implement knob_setting method in Measurement

2. Post-processing : implement post_process function to calculate for example binding energy etc. --> in get_measurements function in the measurement class

3. Apart from surface and ligand - application of 2-D materials to substrates and heterostructures
