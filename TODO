TO-DO Vasp Automation 

1. Kpoints and Encut optimal value in calibrate

2. Write Experiment.py as a separate module. Remove Knobs class and Experiment classes from instrument.py 
Post-processing : names? function to calculate for example binding energy, create this under Experiment script based on create_interface.py 

3. Apart from surface and ligand - application of 2-D materials to substrates and heterostructures
