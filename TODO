2. @josh: setup and Post-processing --> implement setup and make_measurements functions in the Measurement class to calculate for example binding energy etc.

3. @josh: add script that uses the openbabel api to create molecules

4. @josh: check the symbols mapping in the Potcar object

5. Fireworks integration --> finish the post_processing task(should be straight forward once the make_measurement is implemented)

6. Extend the interface module to include  2-D materials on substrates and heterostructure interfaces


Updates 

1. Kpoints now has fully automatic mesh as default (implemented in calibrate.py module)

2. setup_poscar_jobs included in calibrate.py for volume scaling  .. Josh
