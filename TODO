1. Kpoints and Encut optimal value in calibrate -- > implement knob_setting method in Calibrate

2. Measurement class combines interface, calibrate and instrument 
Post-processing : names? function to calculate for example binding energy, create this in the interface class

3. Apart from surface and ligand - application of 2-D materials to substrates and heterostructures
