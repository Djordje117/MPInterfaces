1. in calibrate.py implement setup_matrix jobs

2. @josh: setup and Post-processing --> implement setup and make_measurements functions in the Measurement class to calculate for example binding energy etc.

3. @josh: add script that uses the openbabel api to create molecules

5. Fireworks integration --> finish the post_processing task(should be straight forward once the make_measurement is implemented)

6. Extend the interface module to include  2-D materials on substrates and heterostructure interfaces


Updates 

1. Kpoints now has fully automatic mesh as default (implemented in calibrate.py module)

2. setup_poscar_jobs included in calibrate.py for volume scaling  .. Josh

3. Best for user to input exact POTCAR string for the mapping in case of alternative POTCAR usage
	eg: S stands for default Sulfur , S_GW stands for S_with something , but in the POSCAR both appear as S 
		use symbols = poscar.site_symbols only if the POSCAR string matches perfectly
